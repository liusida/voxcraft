# Voxcraft

This repo is one of the three parts of voxcraft software.

1. voxcraft-sim: A highly parallelized physics engine that can simulate the voxel-based soft robots. This part utilizes CUDA and GPU.

2. voxcraft-evo: The evolutionary algorithms that can automatically design voxel-based soft robots.

3. voxcraft-vis: The visualization tool that can playback the history file produced by voxcraft-sim, and it can used for manually design bots and run it in a CPU-based physics engine.
